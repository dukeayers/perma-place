# perma-place
An easy way of creating a permanent placeholder for bootstrap.


# Downloading the Project

Download the files independently or copy/paste them from the project. Simply link them in your code.

# Getting Started

Simply add  `data-permanent-placeholder="{}"` where {} is the text you want to display within the permanent placeholder. This will create a place holder with the default position values.

Because the permanent placeholder acts as an extension to the input, both the input and placeholder should be wrapped in a div.

### data-permanent-pos-r

Sets the right pixel value of the permanent placeholder. Expects a numeric value with no added "px".

### data-permanent-pos-l

Sets the left pixel value of the permanent placeholder. Expects a numeric value with no added "px".

### data-permanent-pos-t
Sets the top pixel value of the permanent placeholder. Expects a numeric value with no added "px".

### data-permanent-pos-b
Sets the bottom pixel value of the permanent placeholder. Expects a numeric value with no added "px".

### data-permanent-pos-v

Vertically aligns the permanent placeholder but still allows the user to control the left/right position. Expects any true value.
